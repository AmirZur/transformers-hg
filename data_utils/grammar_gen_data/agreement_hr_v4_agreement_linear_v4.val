our quails confuse the walruses above our xylophone
the newt applauds the xylophones below our salamander
her xylophone that some orangutan high_fives applauds our ravens that amuse her vultures
my quails that entertain some unicorns entertain some peacock
our orangutans that confuse our vultures confuse her xylophone that her quails confuse
